His name is Mike Dane, he has a lot video about programming language.

I publish the repository for if you want check your code or don't want to write all code in video.

I divide all tutorials in regions at visualstudio.If you want to run code, select the code and do CRTL K + CTRL U (or just click the text undo botton).

I took some notes in comments block.You might want to look them.

If some classes have an error, copy the non-existing file (like Book.cs) in the ConsoleAPP1 folder on desktop or download folder.
